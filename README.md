Backend:

Technologies Used:

Handlebars, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery

Unsolved Issues:

The app needs a great deal of styling, and several key features for setting a tone
were not built. The biggest feature is a backend feature, however- rather than
making multiple layered promises, I'd like to be able to make a single API call
and receive the desired response.
